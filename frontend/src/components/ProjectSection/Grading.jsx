            <h2>Grading for Numerical Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                In the Spring of 2025, I was the student grader 
                for Numerical Analysis. This is a Computer 
                Science class where we go over many types of 
                functions and equations and students have to 
                write code to calculate some of these equations.
                I took this class in Spring 2024, and because of
                my high grade and dedication to the class, I was 
                aksed to be the student grader. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As the grader for this class, I was responsible for 
                grading all of the homeworks, quizzes, and the midterm.
                There were five quizzes and five homework assignments.
                For each assignment, I had a week to grade before I checked
                back in with the professor. I had weekly meetings with the 
                professor. I always stayed on top of grading, and because of
                that, I was asked to be a grader once again for Spring 2026.
